# SpringMVCFilmCRUD


## Overview
This team project saw three individuals putting several technologies and design patterns into practice to produce a Full-Stack    project which creates, reads, updates, and deletes (CRUD) from a film database while collaborating remotely via Zoom and Slack.

## User Stories

* User Story 1: A user can enter a Film's ID and see the details of the film in a web page. If the film is not found, they see an appropriate message.
* User Story 2: A user can choose to add a new film. They can enter all the properties of the film. Their input will be used to create Film object, which the DAO implementation will save in the database. If the insert fails, the user is informed of this.
* User Story 3: When a user retrieves a film, they have the option of deleting it. If they delete the film, it is removed from the database. If the delete fails (such as, due to child records), the user is informed of this.
* User Story 5: A user can search for films by keyword/pattern in title or description. From the resulting list of films, the user can choose to update or delete a record.
* User Story 6: When a film's details are displayed, its actors and categories are also listed.
