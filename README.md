# SpringMVCFilmCRUD
## Authors


##Overview
Create a full-stack Spring MVC web application that allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete persistent records.

This is a team project: you will collaborate with your teammates to complete this project.

One teammate will own the Github repository that the rest of the team will share.

This teammate will start the project in Spring Tool Suite, initialize it with Git, create the Github repository, and link and push the project to Github.

The rest of the team will clone the project and import it into their STS.

All team members will push their work to the same Github repository.
Before proceeding, your team needs to pick the project repo owner.

##User Stories
###User Story 1
A user can enter a Film's ID and see the details of the film in a web page. If the film is not found, they see an appropriate message.

###User Story 2
A user can choose to add a new film. They can enter all the properties of the film. Their input will be used to create Film object, which the DAO implementation will save in the database. If the insert fails, the user is informed of this.

###User Story 3
When a user retrieves a film, they have the option of deleting it. If they delete the film, it is removed from the database. If the delete fails (such as, due to child records), the user is informed of this.

###User Story 5
A user can search for films by keyword/pattern in title or description. From the resulting list of films, the user can choose to update or delete a record.

###User Story 6
When a film's details are displayed, its actors and categories are also listed.
